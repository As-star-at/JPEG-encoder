# IMAGE ENCODER USING PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
## INTRODUCTION
This project implements a custom JPEG image encoder, leveraging the power of parallel programming
using CUDA and OpenCV, with the core logic written in C++. The aim is to demonstrate the efficiency
and performance improvements achieved through parallelization as compared to the traditional sequential methods.

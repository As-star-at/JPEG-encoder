# IMAGE ENCODER USING PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
INTRODUCTION
This project implements a custom JPEG image encoder, leveraging the power of parallel programming
using CUDA and OpenCV, with the core logic written in C++. The aim is to demonstrate the efficiency
and benefits of parallel computing in handling computationally intensive tasks like image encoding by
offloading processing to GPUs. The report details the step-by-step process of JPEG compression, showcasing the performance improvements achieved through parallelization compared to thetraditional sequential methods.
